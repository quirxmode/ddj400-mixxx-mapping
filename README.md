# DDJ-400 mapping by quirxmode

This mapping changes the behavior of the loop controls to be more in line with what is described in the user manual. Imho this mapping is more intuitive. Note that it does *not* work with Mixxx main currently because it requires a small patch. The branch can be found at https://github.com/quirxmode/mixxx/tree/beatloop_keep_loopin.
