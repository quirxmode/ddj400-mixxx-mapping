# DDJ-400 mapping by quirxmode

This mapping changes the behavior of the loop controls to be more in line with what is described in the user manual. Imho this mapping is more intuitive. Note that it does *not* work with Mixxx main currently because it requires a small patch. The branch can be found at https://github.com/quirxmode/mixxx/tree/beatloop_keep_loopin.

The 4D-mapping adds deck-switching to turn the DDJ-400 into a 4-deck controller. Decks can be switched by double-pressing shift. *Please read the comments* in the Pioneer-DDJ-400-quirx-script.js file for how it works. Warning: it can be *very* confusing because the DDJ-400 does not have a good way to indicate which deck you are controlling. Also, its mixer does not support 4 decks either.
